            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I began my TEEF course during the 12th grade at the age of 17, managing both high school and the course simultaneously. 
                Before completing the course, I earned my Level 2 Pilates certification. After finishing my studies, I launched my own company, Iron Taurus.
                As part of this venture, I started teaching fitness classes at Fitness Hut, where I have worked since 2022. 
                Additionally, I worked as a personal trainer for six months at two different gyms. I later paused personal training to focus on college but continued 
                teaching classes. During the first year of my college degree in Computer Engineering and Electronics, 
                I did a professional course at MasterD for Video Games Programming along with other online courses.</p>

            <h2>Experiences</h2>
            <p>While I donâ€™t have formal work experience in IT, I have worked on several projects that have helped me develop my skills. 
                My most notable project is a freelance job 'Aggregator', which is showcased in my Projects section. 
                Beyond that, I have completed multiple projects both in college and independently, including those from the Unity course I did. 
                All of these are available in the Projects tab.
