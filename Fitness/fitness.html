            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I began my TEEF course during the 12th grade at the age of 17, managing both high school and the course simultaneously. 
                Before completing the course, I earned my Level 2 Pilates certification. After finishing my studies, I launched my own company, Iron Taurus.
                As part of this venture, I started teaching fitness classes at Fitness Hut, where I have worked since 2022. 
                Additionally, I worked as a personal trainer for six months at two different gyms. I later paused personal training to focus on college but continued 
                teaching classes. During the first year of my college degree in Computer Engineering and Electronics, 
                I did a professional course at MasterD for Video Games Programming along with other online courses.

            <h2>Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                I worked at Fitness Hut in São Domingos de Rana and periodically at People Club in Cacém. Additionally, I conducted personal classes at 
                Lidl's headquarters gym in Linhó. In these gyms, I taught Pilates, Yoga, GAP, HIIT, Localized training, Weight Localized training, and Step classes. 
                As an athlete, I have been involved in obstacle course racing (OCR) since the age of 13, competing in multiple events and earning several trophies.
                I also participate in running events and spent a year competing in weightlifting tournaments.
